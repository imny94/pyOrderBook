## Standard to follow when writing your part:


### 1.  open your own branch! 
	don't manipulate with the master branch!
	if you are going to merge it, explain your implementation to others
	and if they get your idea and don't have any other disagreement. 
	Then, it is safe to merge and don't forget to let others know.


### 2.  write down your progress!
	This is our current progress trello group :
	https://trello.com/invite/b/CcvQef6G/10ddd6da30833b1a0cd0a05c97f0fdef/bitcoin

	Everyone should write down 
	what you are currenntly implementing and how is your current progress.
	It is very important for others to catch on !!!!!!!!


### 3.  If you are going to catch up other one's part, talk to them first !!
	don't redo work! talk to them and know their current status!
